.SH NAME
.PP
jira-issue-list - List lists issues in a project


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBjira issue list [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
List lists issues in a given project.

You can combine different flags to create a unique query. For instance,


.SH Issues that are of high priority, is in progress, was created this month, and has given labels
.PP
jira issue list -yHigh -s"In Progress" --created month -lbackend -l"high prio"
