This tool mostly focuses on issue search and navigation at the moment. However, it also includes features like issue creation,
updating a ticket status, and so on. Note that the tool is only tested with the latest Jira cloud.

## Installation
Install the runnable binary to your `$GOPATH/bin`.

```sh
$ go get github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli/cmd/jira
```

Releases and other installation options will be available later.

## Getting started
1. [Get a Jira API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and export it to your shell as a `JIRA_API_TOKEN` variable.
    Add it to your shell configuration file, for instance, `$HOME/.bashrc`, so that the variable is always available.
2. Run `jira init` to generate a config file required for the tool.

#### Shell completion
Check `jira completion --help` for more info on setting up a bash/zsh shell completion. 

#### Known issues
- A key event is lost in mac OS when switching back and forth from view mode to list mode - [tcell/issues#194](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/194)

## Usage
The tool currently comes with an issue, epic, and sprint explorer. The flags are [POSIX-compliant](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html).
You can combine available flags in any order to create a unique query. For example, the command below will give you high priority issues created this month
with status `To Do` that are assigned to you and has a label `backend`.
```sh
$ jira issue list -yHigh -s"To Do" --created month -lbackend -a$(jira me)
```

##### Navigation
The lists are displayed in an interactive UI by default. 
- Use arrow keys or `j, k, h, l` characters to navigate through the list.
- Use `g` and `SHIFT+G` to quickly navigate to the top and bottom respectively.
- Press `v` to view selected issue details.
- Hit `ENTER` to open the selected issue in the browser.
- Press `c` to copy issue URL to the system clipboard. This requires `xclip` / `xsel` in linux.
- Press 'CTRL+K' to copy issue key to the system clipboard.
- In an explorer view, press `w` to toggle focus between the sidebar and the contents screen.
- Press `q` / `ESC` / `CTRL+C` to quit.

### Issue
Issues are displayed in an interactive table view by default. You can output the results in a plain view using the `--plain` flag.

#### List
The `list` command lets you search and navigate the issues.

```sh
# List recent issues
$ jira issue list

# List issues created in last 7 days
$ jira issue list --created -7d

# List issues in status "To Do"
$ jira issue list -s"To Do"

# List recent issues in plain mode 
$ jira issue list --plain
```

### Epic
Epics are displayed in an explorer view by default. You can output the results in a table view using the `--table` flag.
When viewing epic issues, you can use all filters available for the issue command.

See [usage](#navigation) to learn more about UI interaction.

#### List
You can use all flags supported by `issue list` command here except for the issue type.

```sh
# List epics
$ jira epic list

# List epics in a table view
$ jira epic list --table

# List epics reported by me and are open
$ jira epic list -r$(jira me) -sOpen

# List issues in an epic
$ jira epic list KEY-1

# List all issue in an epic KEY-1 that is unassigned and has a high priority
$ jira epic list KEY-1 -ax -yHigh

# List high priority epics
$ jira epic list KEY-1 -yHigh
```

#### Create
Creating an epic is same as creating the issue except you also need to provide an epic name. 

```sh
# Create an issue using interactive prompt
$ jira epic create

# Pass required parameters to skip prompt or use --no-input flag to skip prompt for non-mandatory params
$ jira epic create -n"Epic epic" -s"Everything" -yHigh -lbug -lurgent -b"Epic description"
```

### Sprint
Sprints are displayed in an explorer view by default. You can output the results in a table view using the `--table` flag.
When viewing sprint issues, you can use all filters available for the issue command. The tool only shows 25 recent sprints.

See [usage](#navigation) to learn more about UI interaction.

```sh
# List sprints in an exporer view
$ jira sprint list

# List sprints in a table view
$ jira sprint list --table

# List issues in current active sprint
$ jira sprint list --current

# List issues in current active sprint that are assigned to me
$ jira sprint list --current -a$(jira me)

# List issues in previous sprint
$ jira sprint list --prev

# List issues in next planned sprint
$ jira sprint list --next

# List future and active sprints
$ jira sprint list --state future,active

# List issues in a particular sprint. You can use all flags supported by issue list command here. 
# To get sprint id use `jira sprint list` or `jira sprint list --table`
$ jira sprint list SPRINT_ID

# List high priority issues in a sprint are assigned to me
$ jira sprint list SPRINT_ID -yHigh -a$(jira me)
```

## Scripts
Often times, you may want to use the output of the command to do something cool. However, the default interactive UI might not allow you to do that.
The tool comes with the `--plain` flag that displays results in a simple layout that can then be manipulated from the shell script.    

Some example scripts are listed below.

<details><summary>Tickets created per day this month</summary>

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

tickets=$(jira issue list --created month --plain --columns created --no-headers | awk '{print $1}' | awk -F'-' '{print $3}' | sort -n | uniq -c)

echo "${tickets}" | while IFS=$'\t' read -r line; do
  day=$(echo "${line}" | awk '{print $2}')
  count=$(echo "${line}" | awk '{print $1}')

  printf "Day #%s: %s\n" "${day}" "${count}"
done

# Output
Day #01: 19
Day #02: 10
Day #03: 21
...
```
</details>

<details><summary>Number of tickets per sprint</summary>

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

sprints=$(jira sprint list --table --plain --columns id,name --no-headers)

echo "${sprints}" | while IFS=$'\t' read -r id name; do
  count=$(jira sprint list "${id}" --table --plain --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

  printf "%10s: %3d\n" "${name}" $((count))
done

# Output
Sprint 3:   55
Sprint 2:   40
Sprint 1:   30
...
```
</details>

<details><summary>Number of unique assignee per sprint</summary>

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

sprints=$(jira sprint list --table --plain --columns id,name --no-headers)

echo "${sprints}" | while IFS=$'\t' read -r id name; do
  count=$(jira sprint list "${id}" --table --plain --columns assignee --no-headers 2>/dev/null | sort -n | uniq | wc -l)

  printf "%10s: %3d\n" "${name}" $((count))
done

# Output
Sprint 3:   5
Sprint 2:   4
Sprint 1:   3
```
</details>
